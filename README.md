## About

This repository includes the files to set-up WSL2 distro to run systemd.

If you are using Windows Insider builds greater than 21286 you should use the [`build-21286+` branch](https://github.com/diddledan/one-script-wsl2-systemd/tree/build-21286+)

### What does it do

#### In WSL2
- Install a script that starts systemd inside a process namespace so that it gets PID 1.
- Install a sudoers configuration file that allows the script to call itself as root without requring setuid.
- Install GPG and SSH agent relays to Windows equivalents.
- Install WSLUtilities
- Configure your WSL sessions to connect to an X11 server in Windows.
- Configure xdg-open to open files and addresses in Windows

#### In Windows
- Install GPG4Win via winget.exe, which is available in the latest dev branch of Windows 10 Insider Preview. (disable this with `-NoGPG`)
- Add a scheduled task that launches when you login to Windows to start the GPG-Agent from GPG4Win
- Install a custom WSL kernel based on the Microsoft sources with AppArmor added to support [Snap Package](https://snapcraft.io) strict confinement.
- Add a scheduled task that launches when you login to Windows to update the custom kernel when a new release is made.
- Enable and start the in-built Windows SSH-Agent service.

## Installing

1. Download the `install.ps1` script
1. Open a PowerShell or CMD window: press `Win + x` then choose either "Command Prompt" or "Windows PowerShell" depending on which your system presents in the menu
1. Run the following command in the PowerShell or CMD window to set up your default distro
    ```powershell
    powershell.exe -NonInteractive -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \path\to\install.ps1
    ```
If you want to skip the GPG4Win installation, use the flag `-NoGPG`

You can also specify a distro name with the `-distro` flag, e.g:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NonInteractive -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \path\to\install.ps1 -distro Ubuntu-20.04
```
You will find all the available distros on your system when executing `wsl.exe --list --all` in command prompt

Currently supported distros:
- Ubuntu
- Kali Linux
- Debian
- Alpine
- OpenSUSE
- Any other linux distribution with `apt-get` or `zypper` as packet manager

## Alternatives

- [Damion Gans' installer for the two-script variant](https://github.com/damionGans/ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script/)
- [Genie](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie)
- [My 'change the user shell' variant that supports zsh and fish](https://github.com/diddlesnaps/chsh-variant-wsl2-systemd) I do not keep the change the user shell variant updated so it is likely all sorts of broken.
